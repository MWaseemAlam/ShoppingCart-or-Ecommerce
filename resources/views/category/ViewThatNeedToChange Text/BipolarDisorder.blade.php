<h1>What is bipolar disorder?</h1>
<p>Bipolar disorder is a mental illness marked by extreme shifts in mood. Symptoms can include an extremely elevated mood called mania. They
can also include episodes of depression. Bipolar disorder is also known as bipolar disease or manic depression.</p>
<p>People with bipolar disorder may have trouble managing everyday life tasks at school or work, or maintaining relationships. There’s no cure,
but there are many treatment options available that can help to manage the symptoms.</p>
<h1>Bipolar disorder facts</h1>
<p>Bipolar disorder isn’t a rare brain disorder. In fact, 2.8 percent of U.S. adults — or about 5 million people — have been diagnosed with it.
The average age when people with bipolar disorder begin to show symptoms is 25 years old.</p>
<p>Depression caused by bipolar disorder lasts at least two weeks. A high (manic) episode can last for several days or weeks. Some people will
experience episodes of mood swings several times a year, while others may experience them only rarely.</p>
<h1>Bipolar symptoms</h1>
<p>There are three main symptoms that can occur with bipolar disorder: mania, hypomania, and depression.</p>
<p>While experiencing mania, a person with bipolar disorder may feel an emotional high. They can feel excited, impulsive, euphoric, and full
of energy. During manic episodes, they may also engage in behavior such as:</p>
<li>spending sprees</li>
<li>unprotected sex</li>
<li>drug use</li>
<p>Hypomania is generally associated with bipolar II disorder. It’s similar to mania, but it’s not as severe. Unlike mania, hypomania may not
result in any trouble at work, school, or in social relationships. However, people with hypomania still notice changes in their mood.</p>
<p>During an episode of depression you may experience:</p>
<li>deep sadness</li>
<li>hopelessness</li>
<li>loss of energy</li>
<li>lack of interest in activities they once enjoyed</li>
<li>periods of too little or too much sleep</li>
<li>suicidal thoughts</li>
<p>Although it’s not a rare condition, bipolar disorder can be hard to diagnose because of its varied symptoms.</p>
<h1>Bipolar symptoms in women</h1>
<p>Men and women are diagnosed with bipolar disorder in equal numbers. However, the main symptoms of the disorder
may be different between the two genders. In many cases, a woman with bipolar disorder may:</p>
<li>be diagnosed later in life, in her 20s or 30s</li>
<li>have milder episodes of mania</li>
<li>experience more depressive episodes than manic episodes</li>
<li>have four or more episodes of mania and depression in a year, which is called rapid cycling</li>
<li>experience other conditions at the same time, including thyroid disease, obesity, anxiety disorders, and migraines</li>
<li>have a higher lifetime risk of alcohol use disorder</li>
<p>Women with bipolar disorder may also relapse more often. This is believed to be caused by hormonal changes related to
menstruation, pregnancy, or menopause. If you’re a woman and think you may have bipolar disorder, it’s important for you to get the facts.</p>
<h1>Bipolar symptoms in men</h1>
<p>Men and women both experience common symptoms of bipolar disorder. However, men may experience symptoms differently
than women. Men with bipolar disorder may:</p>
<li>be diagnosed earlier in life</li>
<li>experience more severe episodes, especially manic episodes</li>
<li>have substance abuse issues</li>
<li>act out during manic episodes</li>
<p>Men with bipolar disorder are less likely than women to seek medical care on their own. They’re also more likely to die by suicide.</p>
<h1>Types of bipolar disorder</h1>
<p>There are three main types of bipolar disorder: bipolar I, bipolar II, and cyclothymia.</p>
<h1>Bipolar I</h1>
<p>Bipolar I is defined by the appearance of at least one manic episode. You may experience hypomanic or major depressive episodes before
and after the manic episode. This type of bipolar disorder affects men and women equally.</p>
<h1>Bipolar II</h1>
<p>People with this type of bipolar disorder experience one major depressive episode that lasts at least two weeks. They also have at least
one hypomanic episode that lasts about four days. This type of bipolar disorder is thought to be more common in women.</p>
<h1>Cyclothymia</h1>
<p>People with cyclothymia have episodes of hypomania and depression. These symptoms are shorter and less severe than the mania and
depression caused by bipolar I or bipolar II disorder. Most people with this condition only experience a month or two at a time where
their moods are stable.</p>
<p>When discussing your diagnosis, your doctor will be able to tell you what kind of bipolar disorder you have.</p>
<h1>Bipolar disorder in children</h1>
<p>Diagnosing bipolar disorder in children is controversial. This is largely because children don’t always display the same bipolar
symptoms as adults. Their moods and behaviors may also not follow the standards doctors use to diagnose the disorder in adults.</p>
<p>Many bipolar symptoms that occur in children also overlap with symptoms from a range of other disorders that can occur in children,
such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).</p>
<p>However, in the last few decades, doctors and mental health professionals have come to recognize the condition in children. A diagnosis
can help children get treatment, but reaching a diagnosis may take many weeks or months. Your child may need to seek special care from a
professional trained to treat children with mental health issues.</p>
<p>Like adults, children with bipolar disorder experience episodes of elevated mood. They can appear very happy and show signs of excitable
behavior. These periods are then followed by depression. While all children experience mood changes, changes caused by bipolar disorder
are very pronounced. They’re also usually more extreme than a child’s typical mood swing.</p>
<h1>Manic symptoms in children</h1>
<p>Symptoms of a child’s manic episode caused by bipolar disorder can include:</p>
<li>acting very silly and feeling overly happy</li>
<li>talking fast and rapidly changing subjects</li>
<li>having trouble focusing or concentrating</li>
<li>doing risky things or experimenting with risky behaviors</li>
<li>having a very short temper that leads quickly to outbursts of anger</li>
<li>having trouble sleeping and not feeling tired after sleep loss</li>
<h1>Depressive symptoms in children</h1>
<p>Symptoms of a child’s depressive episode caused by bipolar disorder can include:</p>
<li>moping around or acting very sad</li>
<li>sleeping too much or too little</li>
<li>having little energy for normal activities or showing no signs of interest in anything</li>
<li>complaining about not feeling well, including having frequent headaches or stomachaches</li>
<li>experiencing feelings of worthlessness or guilt</li>
<li>eating too little or too much</li>
<li>thinking about death and possibly suicide</li>
<h1>Other possible diagnoses</h1>
<p>Some of the behavior issues you may witness in your child could be the result of another condition. ADHD and other behavior disorders can
occur in children with bipolar disorder. Work with your child’s doctor to document your child’s unusual behaviors, which will help lead to
a diagnosis.</p>
<p>Finding the correct diagnosis can help your child’s doctor determine treatments that can help your child live a healthy life.</p>
<h1>Bipolar disorder in teens</h1>
<p>Angst-filled behavior is nothing new to the average parent of a teenager. The shifts in hormones, plus the life changes that come with
puberty, can make even the most well-behaved teen seem a little upset or overly emotional from time to time. However, some teenage mood
swings may be the result of a more serious condition, such as bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>A bipolar disorder diagnosis is most common during the late teens and early adult years. For teenagers, the more common symptoms of a
manic episode include:</p>
<li>being very happy</li>
<li>“acting out” or misbehaving</li>
<li>taking part in risky behaviors</li>
<li>abusing substances</li>
<li>thinking about sex more than usual</li>
<li>becoming overly sexual or sexually active</li>
<li>having trouble sleeping but not showing signs of fatigue or being tired</li>
<li>having a very short temper</li>
<li>having trouble staying focused, or being easily distracted</li>
<p>For teenagers, the more common symptoms of a depressive episode include:</p>
<li>sleeping a lot or too little</li>
<li>eating too much or too little</li>
<li>feeling very sad and showing little excitability</li>
<li>withdrawing from activities and friends</li>
<li>thinking about death and suicide</li>
<p>Diagnosing and treating bipolar disorder can help teens live a healthy life.</p>
<h1>Bipolar and depression</h1>
<p>Bipolar disorder can have two extremes: up and down. To be diagnosed with bipolar, you must experience a period of mania or hypomania.
People generally feel “up” in this phase of the disorder. When you’re experiencing an “up” mood swing, you may feel highly energized
and be easily excitable.</p>
<p>Some people with bipolar disorder will also experience a major depressive episode, or a “down” mood. When you’re experiencing a “down”
mood swing, you may feel lethargic, unmotivated, and sad. However, not all people with bipolar disorder who have this symptom feel “down”
enough to be labeled depressed. For instance, for some people, once their mania is treated, a normal mood may feel like depression because
they enjoyed the “high” caused by the manic episode.</p>
<p>While bipolar disorder can cause you to feel depressed, it’s not the same as the condition called depression. Bipolar disorder can
cause highs and lows, but depression causes moods and emotions that are always “down.” Discover the differences between bipolar disorder
and depression.</p>
<h1>Causes of bipolar disorder</h1>
<p>Bipolar disorder is a common mental health disorder, but it’s a bit of a mystery to doctors and researchers. It’s not yet clear what
causes some people to develop the condition and not others.</p>
<p>Possible causes of bipolar disorder include:</p>
<h1>Genetics</h1>
<p>If your parent or sibling has bipolar disorder, you’re more likely than other people to develop the condition (see below). However,
it’s important to keep in mind that most people who have bipolar disorder in their family history don’t develop it.</p>
<h1>Your brain</h1>
<p>Your brain structure may impact your risk for the disease. Abnormalities in the structure or functions of your brain may
increase your risk.</p>
<h1>Environmental factors</h1>
<p>It’s not just what’s in your body that can make you more likely to develop bipolar disorder. Outside factors
may contribute, too. These factors can include:</p>
<li>extreme stress</li>
<li>traumatic experiences</li>
<li>physical illness</li>
<p>Each of these factors may influence who develops bipolar disorder. What’s more likely, however, is that a combination
of factors contributes to the development of the disease.</p>
<h1>Is bipolar hereditary?</h1>
<p>Bipolar disorder can be passed from parent to child. Research has identified a strong genetic link in people with the disorder. If you
have a relative with the disorder, your chances of also developing it are four to six times higher than people without a family history
of the condition.</p>
<p>However, this doesn’t mean that everyone with relatives who have the disorder will develop it. In addition, not everyone with bipolar
disorder has a family history of the disease.</p>
<p>Still, genetics seem to play a considerable role in the incidence of bipolar disorder. If you have a family member with bipolar disorder,
find out whether screening might be a good idea for you.</p>
<h1>Bipolar diagnosis</h1>
<p>A diagnosis of bipolar disorder I involves either one or more manic episodes, or mixed (manic and depressive) episodes. It may also
include a major depressive episode, but it may not. A diagnosis of bipolar II involves one or more major depressive episodes and at
least one episode of hypomania.</p>
<p>To be diagnosed with a manic episode, you must experience symptoms that last for at least one week or that cause you to be hospitalized.
You must experience symptoms almost all day every day during this time. Major depressive episodes, on the other hand, must last for at
least two weeks.</p>
<p>Bipolar disorder can be difficult to diagnose because mood swings can vary. It’s even harder to diagnose in children and adolescents.
This age group often has greater changes in mood, behavior, and energy levels.</p>
<p>Bipolar disorder often gets worse if it’s left untreated. Episodes may happen more often or become more extreme. But if you receive
treatment for your bipolar disorder, it’s possible for you to lead a healthy and productive life. Therefore, diagnosis is very important.</p>
<h1>Bipolar symptoms test</h1>
<p>One test result doesn’t make a bipolar disorder diagnosis. Instead, your doctor will use
several tests and exams. These may include:</p>
<li><b>Physical exam.</b> Your doctor will do a full physical exam. They may also order blood or urine tests to
rule out other possible causes of your symptoms.</li>
<li><b>Mental health evaluation.</b> Your doctor may refer you to a mental health professional such as a psychologist or psychiatrist. These doctors
diagnose and treat mental health conditions such as bipolar disorder. During the visit, they will evaluate your mental health and look for
signs of bipolar disorder.</li>
<li><b>Mood journal.</b> If your doctor suspects your behavior changes are the result of a mood disorder like bipolar, they may ask you to chart your
moods. The easiest way to do this is to keep a journal of how you’re feeling and how long these feelings last. Your doctor may also suggest
that you record your sleeping and eating patterns.</li>
<li><b>Diagnostic criteria.</b> The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) is an outline of symptoms for various mental health
disorders. Doctors can follow this list to confirm a bipolar diagnosis.</li>
<p>Your doctor may use other tools and tests to diagnose bipolar disorder in addition to these. </p>
<h1>Bipolar disorder treatment</h1>
<p>Several treatments are available that can help you manage your bipolar disorder. These include medications, counseling, and lifestyle
changes. Some natural remedies may also be helpful.</p>
<h1>Medications</h1>
<p>Recommended medications may include:</p>
<li>mood stabilizers, such as lithium (Lithobid)</li>
<li>antipsychotics, such as olanzapine (Zyprexa)</li>
<li>antidepressant-antipsychotics, such as fluoxetine-olanzapine (Symbyax)</li>
<li>benzodiazepines, a type of anti-anxiety medication such as alprazolam (Xanax) that may be used for short-term treatment</li>
<h1>Psychotherapy</h1>
<p>Recommended psychotherapy treatments may include:</p>
<h1>Cognitive behavioral therapy</h1>
<p>Cognitive behavioral therapy is a type of talk therapy. You and a therapist talk about ways to manage your bipolar disorder.
They will help you understand your thinking patterns. They can also help you come up with positive coping strategies.</p>
<h1>Psychoeducation</h1>
<p>Psychoeducation is a kind of counseling that helps you and your loved ones understand the disorder. Knowing more about bipolar disorder
will help you and others in your life manage it.</p>
<h1>Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy</h1>
<p>Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy (IPSRT) focuses on regulating daily habits, such as sleeping, eating, and exercising.
Balancing these everyday basics can help you manage your disorder.</p>
<h1>Other treatment options</h1>
<p>Other treatment options may include:</p>
<li>electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)</li>
<li>sleep medications</li>
<li>supplements</li>

<li>ask a friend or relative to support your treatment plans</li>
<li>talk to a doctor or licensed healthcare provider</li>
<p>Other lifestyle changes can also help relieve depressive symptoms caused by bipolar disorder. </p>
<h1>Natural remedies for bipolar disorder</h1>
<p>Some natural remedies may be helpful for bipolar disorder. However, it’s important not to use these
remedies without first talking with your doctor. These treatments could interfere with medications you’re taking.</p>
<p>The following herbs and supplements may help stabilize your mood and relieve symptoms of bipolar disorder:</p>
<li><b>Fish oil.</b> A 2013 study shows that people who consume a lot of fish and fish oil are less likely to develop bipolar disease.
You can eat more fish to get the oil naturally, or you can take an over-the-counter (OTC) supplement.</li>
<li><b>Rhodiola rosea.</b> This research also shows that this plant may be a helpful treatment for moderate depression.
It may help treat depressive symptoms of bipolar disorder.</li>
<li><b>S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe).</b> SAMe is an amino acid supplement. The research shows it can ease symptoms
of major depression and other mood disorders.</li>
<p>Several other minerals and vitamins may also reduce symptoms of bipolar disorder.</p>
<h1>Tips for coping and support</h1>
<p>If you or someone you know has bipolar disorder, you’re not alone. Bipolar disorder
affects about 60 million people around the world.</p>
<p>One of the best things you can do is to educate yourself and those around you. There are many resources available. For instance, SAMHSA’s
behavioral health treatment services locator provides treatment information by ZIP code. You can also find additional resources at
the site for the National Institute of Mental Health.</p>
<p>If you think you’re experiencing symptoms of bipolar disorder, make an appointment with your doctor. If you think a friend, relative, or
loved one may have bipolar disorder, your support and understanding is crucial. Encourage them to see a doctor about any symptoms they’re
having. And read how to help someone living with bipolar disorder.</p>
<h1>Bipolar and relationships</h1>
<p>When it comes to managing a relationship while you live with bipolar disorder, honesty is the best policy. Bipolar disorder can have an
impact on any relationship in your life, perhaps especially on a romantic relationship. So, it’s important to be open about your condition.</p>
<p>There’s no right or wrong time to tell someone you have bipolar disorder. Be open and honest as soon as you’re ready. Consider sharing
these facts to help your partner better understand the condition:</p>
<li>when you were diagnosed</li>
<li>what to expect during your depressive phases</li>
<li>what to expect during your manic phases</li>
<li>how you typically treat your moods</li>
<li>how they can be helpful to you</li>
<p>One of the best ways to support and make a relationship successful is to stick with your treatment. Treatment helps you reduce symptoms
and scale back the severity of your mood swings. With these aspects of the disorder under control, you can focus more on your relationship.</p>
<h1>Living with bipolar disorder</h1>
<p>Bipolar disorder is a chronic mental illness. That means you’ll live and cope with it for the rest of your life. However,
that doesn’t mean you can’t live a happy, healthy life.</p>
<p>Treatment can help you manage your mood swings and cope with your symptoms. To get the most out of treatment, you may want to create a
care team to help you. In addition to your primary doctor, you may want to find a psychiatrist and psychologist. Through talk therapy,
these doctors can help you cope with symptoms of bipolar disorder that medication can’t help.</p>
<p>You may also want to seek out a supportive community. Finding other people who’re also living with this disorder can give you a group of
people you can rely on and turn to for help.</p>
<p>Finding treatments that work for you requires perseverance. Likewise, you need to have patience with yourself as you learn to manage
bipolar disorder and anticipate your mood swings. Together with your care team, you’ll find ways to maintain a normal, happy, healthy life.</p>
<p>While living with bipolar disorder can be a real challenge, it can help to maintain a sense of humor about life.</p>
