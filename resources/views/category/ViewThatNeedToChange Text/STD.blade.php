<h1>Facts about STDs</h1>
<p>The term sexually transmitted disease (STD) is used to refer to a condition passed from one person to another through sexual contact. You
can contract an STD by having unprotected vaginal, anal, or oral sex with someone who has the STD.</p>
<p>An STD may also be called a sexually transmitted infection (STI) or venereal disease (VD).</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean sex is the only way STDs are transmitted. Depending on the specific STD, infections may also be transmitted through
sharing needles and breastfeeding.</p>
<h1>Symptoms of STDs in men</h1>
<p>It’s possible to contract an STD without developing symptoms. But some STDs cause obvious symptoms.
In men, common symptoms include:</p>
<li>pain or discomfort during sex or urination</li>
<li>sores, bumps, or rashes on or around the penis, testicles, anus, buttocks, thighs, or mouth</li>
<li>unusual discharge or bleeding from the penis</li>
<li>painful or swollen testicles</li>
<h1>Symptoms of STDs in women</h1>
<p>In many cases, STDs don’t cause noticeable symptoms. When they do, common STD symptoms in women include:</p>
<li>pain or discomfort during sex or urination</li>
<li>sores, bumps, or rashes on or around the vagina, anus, buttocks, thighs, or mouth</li>
<li>unusual discharge or bleeding from the vagina</li>
<li>itchiness in or around the vagina</li>
<p>The specific symptoms can vary from one STD to another.</p>
<h1>Types of STDs</h1>
<p>Many different types of infections can be transmitted sexually. The most common STDs are described below.</p>
<h1>Chlamydia</h1>
<p>A certain type of bacteria causes chlamydia. It’s the most commonly reported STD among Americans, notes the .</p>
<p>Many people with chlamydia have no noticeable symptoms. When symptoms do develop, they often include:</p>
<li>pain or discomfort during sex or urination</li>
<li>green or yellow discharge from the penis or vagina</li>
<li>green or yellow discharge from the penis or vagina</li>
<p>If left untreated, chlamydia can lead to:</p>
<li>infections of the urethra, prostate gland, or testicles</li>
<li>pelvic inflammatory disease</li>
<li>infertility</li>
<p>If a pregnant woman has untreated chlamydia, she can pass it to her baby during birth. The baby may develop:</p>
<li>pneumonia</li>
<li>eye infections</li>
<li>blindness</li>
<p>Antibiotics can easily treat chlamydia.</p>
<h1>HPV (human papillomavirus)</h1>
<p>Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a virus that can be passed from one person to another through intimate skin-to-skin or
sexual contact. There are many different strains of the virus. Some are more dangerous than others.</p>
<p>The most common symptom of HPV is warts on the genitals, mouth, or throat.</p>
<p>Some strains of HPV infection can lead to cancer, including:</p>
<li>oral cancer</li>
<li>cervical cancer</li>
<li>vulvar cancer</li>
<li>penile cancer</li>
<li>rectal cancer</li>
<p>While most cases of HPV don’t become cancerous, some strains of the virus are more likely to cause cancer than others. According to the ,
most cases of HPV-related cancer in the United States are caused by HPV 16 and HPV 18. These two strains of HPV account for 70 percent of
all cervical cancer cases.</p>
<p>There’s no treatment for HPV. However, HPV infections often clear up on their own. There’s also a vaccine available to protect against
some of the most dangerous strains, including HPV 16 and HPV 18.
If you contract HPV, proper testing and screenings can help your doctor assess and manage your risk of complications.</p>
<h1>Syphilis</h1>
<p>Syphilis is another bacterial infection. It often goes unnoticed in its early stages.</p>
<p>The first symptom to appear is a small round sore, known as a chancre. It can develop on your genitals, anus, or mouth.
It’s painless but very infectious.</p>
<p>Later symptoms of syphilis can include:</p>
<li>rash</li>
<li>fatigue</li>
<li>fever</li>
<li>headaches</li>
<li>joint pain</li>
<li>weight loss</li>
<li>hair loss</li>
<p>If left untreated, late-stage syphilis can lead to:</p>
<li>loss of vision</li>
<li>loss of hearing</li>
<li>loss of memory</li>
<li>mental illness</li>
<li>infections of the brain or spinal cord</li>
<li>heart disease</li>
<li>death</li>
<p>Fortunately, if caught early enough, syphilis is easily treated with antibiotics. However, syphilis infection in a newborn can be fatal.
That’s why it’s important for all pregnant women to be screened for syphilis.The earlier syphilis is diagnosed and treated, the less damage it does.</p>
<h1>HIV</h1>
<p>HIV can damage the immune system and raise the risk of contracting other viruses or bacteria and certain cancers. If left untreated,
it can lead to stage 3 HIV, known as AIDS. But with today’s treatment, many people living with HIV don’t ever develop AIDS.</p>
<p>In the early or acute stages, it’s easy to mistake the symptoms of HIV with those of the flu. For example, the early symptoms can include:</p>
<li>fever</li>
